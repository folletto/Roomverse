WHY ROOMVERSE
-------------

There are countless chat applications out there and countless collaboration apps,
but after testing many of them I still think they all are missing one of the key
elements of collaboration: the room context.
Roomverse is designed to have a third permanent column that is contextual to
the room you're in, where every room can load its own set of widgets.

So each rooms isn't just a chat, but everyone has also visibility on the contextual
widgets on the side. Everyone sees the same, but every room is different.

Extensibility becomes a clear and key element of such approach.



RANDOM FACTS
------------

* Currently in development. Not feature complete, but works.
* IRC backend to make it useful faster, in the future pluggable.
* Simple to setup: download, install script, run.
